# Instrument-Player
pygame code that lets you play the sounds of a few instruments

I have made this project using pygame.It is basically an app that gives you the option to select a certain instrument and lets you play the sound.

This is a very basic project in the sense that 
1. The tech part where it can be improved is that it does not allow you to play different sounds simultaneously so any PRs are welcome on that and there can be a feature that plays the sounds at regular interval that lets you create a continuous beat
2. The UI is not very good as I could not find suitable and appropriate sounds that can make good beats so any new audio files and icons for the instruments that make it sound and look better are highly appreciated
3. Please feel free to add more intruments, I think even a beginner will find it quite easy to do so.

To run this project one needs to fork the whole repository and just type "python3 2.py" in the command line
